## Introduction

Maze-Pathfinder is an application developed using Python's Pygame library. The purpose of this application is to visually demonstrate the workings of various pathfinding algorithms on a maze. Algorithms included in this project are Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Greedy-Best-First-Search (GBFS), A* Search (A*) and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

-   Interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI)
-   Five different pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, GBFS, A\*, and Dijkstra's
-   A maze generation feature using Prim's algorithm
-   Option to reset and choose a different algorithm to run

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/RayWangyangMa/Maze-Pathfinder`
3. Navigate into the project directory: `cd Maze-Pathfinder`

## How to Use

Run the main Python file: `python main.py`

Once the application starts, you'll see a selection menu with five buttons, each representing a different pathfinding algorithm. Select an algorithm and press the "Start" button. The application will generate a new maze and apply the selected algorithm to find a path from the start to the end node. After the algorithm completes, you can either reset the application or go back to the main menu to select another algorithm.
